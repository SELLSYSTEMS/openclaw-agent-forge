# Decisions

## 2026-04-13

### Use an isolated local OpenClaw runtime

- Decision: set `OPENCLAW_HOME=/home/OpenClaw/.openclaw-home`
- Why: prevents session, config, and runtime state from colliding with other agents or global CLI state

### Use file-based memory as the primary memory system

- Decision: store memory in local Markdown files under `/home/OpenClaw/memory`
- Why: transparent, local, easy for agents to read, easy to diff, and operationally simpler than a vector database

### Keep Obsidian optional

- Decision: if a GUI is needed later, use Obsidian on the same `memory/` folder
- Why: this keeps one source of truth while adding a human-friendly editor
